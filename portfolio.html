									  <p>I collaborated with academic staff the last 3 years on the iterative development, implementation and evaluation of the gamification of the ‘Computer Game Development’ course offered to 2nd year students. The gamification aims to support course objectives by improving students’ review of course material, increasing meaningful class participation, fostering problem solving skills, increasing lecture attendance and encouraging creativity in practical assignments. This was achieved by enhancing the existing course using various gaming features (narrative, characters, puzzles, quizzes, leader board and rewards) towards learning objectives, motivational affordances, engagement and behavior change.<p></p> We found that the gamification has a positive impact on student engagement with the course. It increased lecture attendance, class participation and student enjoyment. Student engagement in learning activities is a key indicator of high quality learning. Observations suggest that student agency is crucial for a positive emotional response and necessary for students to buy in and realize the learning activity. Digital media can provide such opportunities for learning. However, digital media is assumed to be inherently motivational. This assumption is not empirically supported. I presented this and more at the 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences in January 2016.</p><a id="Educational Games"></a>

									<h4>Enforcer Gauntlet Nero-evolution Tournament</h4>
									 <img class="image fit" src="images/tourn.jpg" alt="" />
									<p>Students find Artificial intelligence challenging. They often consider it as difficult ‘black box’ technologies and mathematical formalisms. I developed the Neuro-evolution Tournament for the 3rd year ‘Machine Learning’ course in consultation with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lecturer. The system scaffolds the complex algorithms of Q-Learning and NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) through an interface with sliders that players can use to configure the fitness functions used to train agents. The agents’ behavior and performance is also clearly apparent in the 3D visualization. The training of AI agents and tournament simulation uses the OPENNERO AI research framework. It is a general-purpose open source platform that aims to simplify the process of implementing machine learning games and of conducting AI experiments. It has been used as a research tool; however, its educational utility still remains to be proven.<p></p>
										Our tournament builds on OpenNERO. Players compete for rank and prizes through personal assessments and the performance of their teams of agents. The tournament is organized around 3 missions and allows for the pre- and post-test evaluation of learning. The missions present players with 3 maze solving problems of varying complexity. Mission 1 requires players to solve a set maze by training a group of simulated robotic agents. Players develop the fitness function to train agents to solve the maze in the shortest time and avoid local minima. Mission 2 complicates the maze by introducing static enemies and the cost of damage suffered by agents. Mission 3 introduces moving enemies and random mazes, requiring students to evolve generalized maze solving agents. <p></p>
										Students reported developing a better understanding of the relationship between the fitness function and the agents’ behavior. They also learned that agents’ behaviors are best tuned over many iterations. However, we did not have enough participants completing the tournament to draw conclusive results. A major stumbling block was the time required to train the agents as result of the computational demand of the NEAT algorithm.

									<h4>A* Pathfinder Serious Game</h4>
									<img class="image fit" src="images/astar.jpg" alt="" />
									<p>We found that students often understood the A* pathfinding algorithm conceptually. However, in practice the recursive steps of the algorithm were not performed systematically. I developed the A* Pathfinder serious game to provide students with a fun drill-and-practice exercise of the algorithm. In the game story Dr. Gerasimov (a scientist that found himself as a head in a jar after a near fatal accident) requires the player to find mechanical components in the maze like laboratories to build a mechanical body for him. The A* Pathfinder Mechanism (a compass like user interface element) scaffolds the learning of the A* Pathfinding algorithm. It is presented in the game story as an ingenious machine that calculates a safe (shortest) path through the laboratories and their traps. As levels progress the Pathfinder malfunctions, requiring students to manually set values. Through this the scaffolding of the learning is gradually removed. When students make mistakes, they set off traps that depleted their health serum and score. Dr. Gerasimov provides feedback to the player. This immediate feedback is highly valued by students and facilitates their mastery of the algorithm. Students report that they found it easier to visualize the execution of the A* algorithm as it was stepped through using the dynamic and interactive serious game. They found the visual aspects and animations of the game appealing. Students rated the immediate feedback and the Pathfinder Mechanism highly valuable when considering what contributed to their learning. The initial iteration of the experimental method for evaluating learning in serious games did not provide statistical evidence for these claims.  However, the second iteration provides statistical evidence that students made significantly less errors in a post-test exercise. I am currently writing a journal paper regarding our latest findings.</p>

									<h4>Film Production - Collaborative Learning Environment</h4>
									<img class="image fit" src="images/phd2.jpg" alt="" /><p>I attained a competitive scholarship from the Collaborative African Virtual Environments System (CAVES) project at the Collaborative Visual Computing (CVC) Laboratory, which aims to develop methods and systems for collaborative visualization. My PhD research contributed towards this objective by developing two virtual environments (using the Unreal Engine 2.0). The systems aim to facilitate collaborative problem-based learning activities in the domain of film production.</p><p>
									Film production is a collaborative endeavor. It requires careful planning and collaboration between the members of a production team. Film students lack experience as members of such teams. The Virtual Film Production System is a networked virtual environment developed with the aim to provide students with a well-developed shared virtual world to contextualize and facilitated the planning and production of a Long Take shot. The scenario was adapted from a Long Take learning activity at the Centre for Film and Media Studies. It required careful planning and choreography between the camera, actor, props and cinematic space. </p><p>The system scaffolds the task through defining roles explicitly and providing role specific functionality. The roles of director, camera operator, and actor are supported. Video analysis and interviews with students reveals that the system benefitted the learning activity, facilitating creativity within constraints and providing an information rich context to develop a plan and choreography for the shot.

My MSc project developed a networked virtual environment with the objective to support a collaborative problem-based learning activity in an online Urban Design educational scenario. <p></p>Collaborative problem definition and goal setting is challenging. The Urban Design problem space is not clearly represented only in drawings and maps. It is difficult to collaboratively visualize, negotiate and manipulate the space using these representations online. The virtual environment provides scaffolding for the collaborative visualization of the urban design problem, which collaborators can inhabit, navigate, organize, negotiate and manipulate. It also supports the activity and solution creation by assigning roles, resources and tasks to participants. The artifact produced and a discourse analysis revealed that the system successfully facilitated the collaborative problem definition and goal setting aspects of the problem-based learning activity.</p><a id="Virtual Reality"></a>

									<p>The game was developed for the <a href="http://www.sci-bono.co.za/">Sci-Bono Discovery Centre</a>. The gravity game is an interactive wall projection physics simulation that enables users to play with 5 types of virtual balls (soccer, basket- ball, tennis, table tennis and golf) in three different gravitational environments: normal gravity (earth), low gravity (moon) and high gravity (planet x). When users move in front of the wall, the shape of their bodies is represented by a blue silhouette on the projection. The aim of the game is to keep the ball up in the air by juggling it with your feet and doing this in different environments demonstrates the principle of gravity. The system uses infrared lights, camera and the OpenCV framework [6] to track the user’s silhouette. The OpenCV polygon silhouette is exposed to the Adobe Flash application to represent the player in the visualization. It also provides a collision shape for the virtual balls physics system.</p>

									<h4><a href="http://www.formula-d.com/">Formula D interactive</a></h4>
									<p>Formula D interactive employs a variety of sensor technologies for its custom-design touch tables and interactive museum exhibits. I participated in the development of 2 large multi-touch displays. The displays use rear projection and Frustrated Total Internal Reflection technology, trapping Infrared light inside an acrylic screen. </p>
									<p>When a user touches the screen, Infrared light leaks through the touch points. The positions of the points are captured with an Infrared camera. We used the TUOI framework to process touch points and communicate them to Adobe Flash creative media applications. The applications support using natural gestures, touching, scaling, rotating and sliding virtual objects across the display with one or both hands. The system enables multiple users to interact simultaneously with the application, facilitating a collaborative experience. </p>
									<p>I participated in the upgrade of the 1.5 x 2 meter Interactive ‘Frog Touch Wall’, an educational media space at the Two Oceans Aquarium (<a href="http://www.aquarium.co.za/">http://www.aquarium.co.za</a>). </p>
									<p>I also participated in the development of the ‘Public Service Explorer’ a 2 x 2 meter multi-touch application for the Centre for Public Service Innovation (<a href="http://www.cpsi.co.za/">http://www.cpsi.co.za</a>). The application enables multiple users to visualize and collaboratively innovate flow charts of processes used in public service.</p>
